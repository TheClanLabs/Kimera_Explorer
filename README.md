# Kimera_Explorer
Open-source hardware project consisting of the creation of a device capable of connecting to the Meshtastic network, using the E22-900M30S radio module but prioritizing portability.

# Under construction

## Features

The goal of this project is to create a portable and powerful device for communicating with the Mestastic mesh.

The following starting parameters are established:

> 1.- It must be able to be powered electrically both by USB connection and by batteries.

> 2.- The radio frequency module will have sufficient power reserves, although it will later be adjusted to meet the legal limits of the country where it is deployed.

> 3.- For simplicity of design, the device will use the information from the GPS integrated in the cell phone to which it is linked.

> 4.- The design will focus on supporting node interconnection, so any type of hardware that adds additional telemetry is ruled out.

> 5.- It must be compatible with a recognized firmware.

> 6.- It must be accessible by BLE
